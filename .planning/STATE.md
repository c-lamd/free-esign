## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Coordinate Mapper folded into Phase 1 (foundational shared dependency; must exist and be tested before any field placement code)
- Roadmap: Zero-alteration export (EXP-02) proven in Phase 2, not deferred — hex-diff test is a Phase 2 success criterion
- Roadmap: PRV-01 + PRV-02 (self-hosted assets, no CDN requests) enforced from Phase 1 scaffolding
- Roadmap: pdf-lib-incremental-save viability must be confirmed during Phase 2 planning (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- Roadmap: react-rnd + zoom-aware coordinate update loop needs prototype before Phase 3 planning is finalized (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- [Phase ?]: pdfjs-dist 5.4.296 (not 4.x) pinned by react-pdf 10.4.1; worker filename is pdf.worker.min.mjs (.mjs not .js)
- [Phase ?]: public/ static copy for pdfjs worker avoids Vite content-hash 404s on redeployment
- [Phase ?]: pdfWorker.ts imported first in DocumentViewer.tsx to prevent react-pdf workerSrc overwrite (Pitfall 3)
- [Phase ?]: Defense-in-depth: MIME AND extension both whitelisted (T-01-06)
- [Phase ?]: wrapImageAsPdf uses embedJpg/embedPng: original image bytes embedded, no canvas rasterization (CLAUDE.md document integrity)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 2 DPI caveat: image px dimensions = PDF points at 72 DPI; export must handle DPI normalization

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 planning: validate `pdf-lib-incremental-save` maintenance status and compatibility with pdf-lib 1.17.1 before writing export code
- Phase 3 planning: prototype react-rnd controlled-mode + zoom-aware PDF-space coordinate update loop before finalizing implementation plan
